ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Spider

Just a curious mind diving into the world of code. Iâ€™m all about turning coffee into code and ideas into reality.

ðŸ‘€ What Iâ€™m Into

- Web Stuff: Crafting websites that not only work but also look pretty darn good. I tinker with HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”like a mad scientist but with fewer explosions.
  
- App Magic: Bringing mobile and desktop apps to life with Flutter, C# and Python. If youâ€™ve got a problem, Iâ€™ve probably got an app idea for it.

 ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

- More Web and App Wizardry: Leveling up my skills in full-stack and mobile development. APIs, cloud, databasesâ€”you name it, Iâ€™m on it.
  
- Not Breaking Things: Also known as learning Git and version control.
